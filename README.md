Clone the repository from Github: git clone https://github.com/your_username/PathwayTPR.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd PathwayTPR
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

To use PathwayTPR, follow these steps:

Prepare your data: PathwayTPR requires gene expression data as input. The data should be in a tab-separated format, with gene names as row names and sample names as column names.
Run the program: python main.py path/to/data.txt
The output will be saved as a tab-separated file in the results directory.
